As a first step             of this project, we constructed a fosmid library from the DNA directly isolated from the             microbial mat without cultivation. Since we could get about 3,500 fosmid clones, we             determined the paired-end sequence of all fosmid clones. Next, we classified all clones             in phylum level based on the information for the origin of the genes identified in the             paired-end sequence and then we selected 179 clones evenly according to the ratio of             each classified phylum to cover whole microbial community. These selected clones were             sequenced by shotgun sequencing method (Sanger). Moreover, we selected 158 fosmid clones             to increase the genomic information in the microbial mat and sequenced all the selected             clones at once by 454 sequencer.",

When mice showed the severe clinical signs or alive at 4 days after inoculation, three mice were sacrificed and their spleens were collected. The pool of spleen homogenate was plated on Chocolate II agar (BD) and then first passage F. tularensis SCHU were grown for 3days. The bacterial suspension was prepared with saline and then mice inoculated with this suspension were sacrificed. The nine times in vivo passages were carried out. Mice were inoculated with 10^8 to 10^9 CFU of SCHU in passage 2 to 5 because low amount of SCHU cannot produce the successive generations of SCHU in early passages. In contrast, mice were inoculated with 10^5 CFU of SCHU in passage 6 to 9.

In the current study, changes in microbial dynamics during laboratory-scale fermentation of makgeolli inoculated with six different kinds of nuruk were evaluated by barcoded pyrosequencing using fungal- and bacterial-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 region and hypervariable regions V1 to V3 of the 16S rRNA gene, respectively.",

        "sample_note": "Methane and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) are simultaneously produced from landfill. Four lab-scale biofilters (BF) packed with pumice and granular activated carbon (10:1, w/w) were operated with 10,000-60,000 ppm CH4 and 10-200 ppm NMVOCs such as dimethyl sulfide (DMS), benzene (B) and toluene (T) at a space velocity of 3 h-1. Ribosomal tag pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR were performed for bacterial community analysis. Methane elimination capacities proportionally increased with methane loads in all BFs. Methane could be removed up to 82.8%, while DMS, B and T were completely removed. Compared to BF 1 without the NMVOCs, DMS alone significantly enhanced the methane removal performance (BF 2), whereas B/T alone had no effect on it (BF 3). However, DMS and B/T together significantly reduced the performance (BF 4). A canonical correspondence analysis result showed that DMS and B/T strongly influenced relative abundances of the microbial composition. DMS significantly diversified and modified the bacterial and methanotrophic communities, but its effect was nullified by coexistence of B/T as same with the performance result. The existence of DMS and B/F favored the growth of Methylosarcina and Methylomonas, respectively, resulting in the substantial change of methanotrophic community. However, methanotrophic population densities on a packing material basis did not significantly differ among the BFs 1-4. It was apparent that the variation of methanotrophic performances resulted from the community change by the NMVOCs. Our results proved that the co-emitted NMVOCs along with methane are an important abiotic factor to influence performance and microbial community of methanotrophic biofilter, and also suggest that interaction effects among NMVOCs are unpredictable.",

Maximum elimination capacity of the tobermolite-biofilter was 8,592 g-CH4Ã¢â‚¬Â¢m-3Ã¢â‚¬Â¢d-1 (10 min), over 5 fold greater than that of the perlite-biofilter. Pyrosequencing results showed that methanotrophs comprised  6 vs. 77% in the perlite- vs. tombermolite-biofilter, respectively. In addition, quantitative PCR showed that methanotrophic population levels were stable in the tobermolite-biofilter during the operation. The results indicated that selective growth and population stability of methanotrophs by tobermolite resulted in the high efficiency in methane-biofiltration.",

Furthermore, AMF community is one of good indicators of soil ecosystem. Therefore, we postulate that the knowledge of AMF diversity responses to different fertilizations could help to direct us towards a more effective fertilization. For such purpose, AMF assemblages in arable soils with over 20-year different fertilizations (organic manure, fertilizer NP, NK and NPK as well as control without fertilization) were investigated.

The growth of Nitrososphaera viennensis on urea suggests that the ureolysis of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) might occur in natural environments. In this study, 15N isotope-tracing indicates that ammonia oxidation occurred upon the addition of urea at a concentration similar to the in situ ammonium content of tea orchard soil (pH 3.75) and forest soil (pH 5.40) and was inhibited by acetylene. Nitrification activity was significantly stimulated by urea fertilization and coupled well with abundance changes in archaeal amoA genes in acidic soils. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes at whole microbial community level demonstrates the active growth of AOA in urea-amended soils. Molecular fingerprinting further shows that changes in DGGE fingerprint patterns of archaeal amoA genes are paralleled by nitrification activity changes. However, bacterial amoA and 16S rRNA genes of AOB were not detected. The results strongly suggest that archaeal ammonia oxidation is supported by hydrolysis of urea and that AOA, from the marine Group 1.1a-associated lineage, dominate nitrification in two acidic soils tested",

        "sample_note": "The metabolic trait of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) cells at micrometer level determines the nitrogen cycle at global scale. Ureolytic metabolism has been proposed as a mechanism for AOB in acid soil to cope with the substrate paucity due to the ionization of ammonia to ammonium, but it remains unclear whether urea hydrolysis could afford AOA greater ecological advantages. By combining DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) and high-throughput pyrosequencing, here we show that autotrophic ammonia oxidation in two acid soils was primarily driven by AOA that contain urease ureC genes. In urea-amended SIP microcosms of forest soil (pH=5.40) and tea orchard soil (pH=3.75), nitrification activity was stimulated significantly by urea hydrolysis, when compared to water-amended soils in which nitrification resulted solely from the oxidation of ammonia generated through mineralization of soil organic nitrogen. The stimulation of nitrification activity by urea fertilization was well paralleled by abundance and composition changes of archaeal amoA genes. Time-course incubations indicated that archaeal amoA genes were increasingly labeled by 13CO2 in both water- and urea-amended soil microcosms. Pyrosequencing of the total 16S rRNA genes at the whole communities level revealed that archaeal populations were highly enriched in the 13C-labeled DNA up to four times greater in soil microcosms amended with urea than water. Furthermore, archaeal ureC gene encoding a subunit of urease was successfully amplified in the 13C-DNA, while bacterial amoA and 16S rRNA genes of AOB were not detected. The 13C-labeling of archaeal amoA, 16S rRNA and ureC genes was abolished when nitrification activity was blocked by acetylene, indicating chemolithoautotrophy of soil AOA. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that autotrophic ammonia oxidation in two acid soils was dominated by urease gene-containing AOA within the marine Group 1.1a-associated lineage. The findings implied that ureolytic metabolism of AOA may be important to global nitrogen cycle.",

Phylogenetic analysis suggested that autotrophic ammonia oxidation in two acid soils was dominated by urease gene-containing AOA within the marine Group 1.1a-associated lineage.

        "study_abstract": "The metabolic trait of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) cells at micrometer level determines the nitrogen cycle at global scale. Ureolytic metabolism has been proposed as a mechanism for AOB in acid soil to cope with the substrate paucity due to the ionization of ammonia to ammonium, but it remains unclear whether urea hydrolysis could afford AOA greater ecological advantages. By combining DNA-based stable isotope probing (SIP) and high-throughput pyrosequencing, here we show that autotrophic ammonia oxidation in two acid soils was primarily driven by AOA that contain urease ureC genes. In urea-amended SIP microcosms of forest soil (pH=5.40) and tea orchard soil (pH=3.75), nitrification activity was stimulated significantly by urea hydrolysis, when compared to water-amended soils in which nitrification resulted solely from the oxidation of ammonia generated through mineralization of soil organic nitrogen. The stimulation of nitrification activity by urea fertilization was well paralleled by abundance and composition changes of archaeal amoA genes. Time-course incubations indicated that archaeal amoA genes were increasingly labeled by 13CO2 in both water- and urea-amended soil microcosms. Pyrosequencing of the total 16S rRNA genes at the whole communities level revealed that archaeal populations were highly enriched in the 13C-labeled DNA up to four times greater in soil microcosms amended with urea than water. Furthermore, archaeal ureC gene encoding a subunit of urease was successfully amplified in the 13C-DNA, while bacterial amoA and 16S rRNA genes of AOB were not detected. The 13C-labeling of archaeal amoA, 16S rRNA and ureC genes was abolished when nitrification activity was blocked by acetylene, indicating chemolithoautotrophy of soil AOA. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that autotrophic ammonia oxidation in two acid soils was dominated by urease gene-containing AOA within the marine Group 1.1a-associated lineage.

The increasing number of novel tick-borne pathogens has been reported during recent decades. The aim of this study was to reveal a diversity of tick microbiomes which may contain as-yet unidentified pathogens using a metagenomic approach. Seven tick species (both field-collected and laboratory-reared) were used in the present study. Purified bacteria-enriched fraction prepared from tick homogenate was subjected to DNA extraction and pyrosequencing after whole genome amplification. Resulting sequence reads were phylotyped using a Batch Learning Self-Organizing Map (BLSOM) program, which allowed phylogenetic estimation based on the similarity of oligonucleotide frequencies, and functionally annotated by BLASTX similarity searches. We showed that ticks harboured a variety of bacteria including those previously associated with human and animal diseases such as genera Anaplasma, Bartonella, Borrelia, Ehrlichia, Francisella, and Rickettsia. Gene sequences associated with bacterial pathogenesis were identified and were suspected to be introduced through horizontal gene transfer. In conclusion, our efforts to construct a database of tick microbes may lead to the empowerment to predict emerging tick-borne diseases.

The increasing number of novel tick-borne pathogens has been reported during recent decades. The aim of this study was to reveal a diversity of tick microbiomes which may contain as-yet unidentified pathogens using a metagenomic approach. Seven tick species (both field-collected and laboratory-reared) were used in the present study. Purified bacteria-enriched fraction prepared from tick homogenate was subjected to DNA extraction and pyrosequencing after whole genome amplification. Resulting sequence reads were phylotyped using a Batch Learning Self-Organizing Map (BLSOM) program, which allowed phylogenetic estimation based on the similarity of oligonucleotide frequencies, and functionally annotated by BLASTX similarity searches. We showed that ticks harboured a variety of bacteria including those previously associated with human and animal diseases such as genera Anaplasma, Bartonella, Borrelia, Ehrlichia, Francisella, and Rickettsia. Gene sequences associated with bacterial pathogenesis were identified and were suspected to be introduced through horizontal gene transfer.

        "sample_note": "Ultrasonication is a common process to dislodge microbes from granular activated carbon (GAC). GAC was sampled from an actual advanced drinking water treatment facility. Effects of ultrasonication (0-396 JÃ¢â‚¬Â¢cm-3) and agitation (30 min at 250 rpm) on bacterial DNA and community recovery from GAC were investigated, using real-time PCR and pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. Carbon fines, produced from GAC during ultrasonication process, were linearly increased with the energy inputs. Ultrasonication alone exhibited no negative effect on population recovery at =66 JÃ¢â‚¬Â¢cm-3, but a strong adverse effect at >66 JÃ¢â‚¬Â¢cm-3. Agitation showed a strongly positive effect on DNA recovery at =40 JÃ¢â‚¬Â¢cm-3 but an adverse effect at >40 JÃ¢â‚¬Â¢cm-3. An experiment with E. coli revealed that the presence of more than 50 mg carbon fine efficiently blocked the DNA extraction. Pyrosequencing results (0, 20 and 30 JÃ¢â‚¬Â¢cm-3 with agitation or not) showed that ultrasonication increased the community richness and diversity, indicating its efficient detachment of bacteria from GAC. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that delivered energy inputs were significantly correlated with the bacterial community composition (p<0.05), but not agitation. Consistently, correspondence analysis revealed that the 6 communities were grouped by the energy inputs but not by agitation.
